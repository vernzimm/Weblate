Formatting
	Text may contain some a specific set of characters that gives information to the game. These must be copied over to the translation. Note, before we start, when I say "You read:", I mean that is how it will appear to you in the game.
	
	1)		__
	2)		{#}
	3)		''
	4)		:@SOME_VARIABLE
	
	There are not many, so lets go through them...

	1)	__	
	1.1)
		Two underscores "__" (Unicode 005F) cause a new line, like hitting the enter key.
		
	1.2)
		There does not need to be a "space" before or after. There can be, but it is not necessary, and may cause a line to wrap, or at the least adds another character to the length of the string.

		Original:	Example text.__More text.
		You read:	Example text.
					More text.

	1.3)
		The use of two sets of two (or more) underscores "____" is possible and creates a blank line between two groups of text, like pressing enter twice.

		Original:	Example text.____More text.
		You read:	Example text.
					
					More text.

	1.4)
		You may add "__" to your translation, or take them away, but be careful. In the game, the text may not fit correctly in the area for it. It is best to use the same structure as the original if possible.

!!	1.5)
		The use of an odd number of underscores "___" causes??? 

		Example text.___More text.
		|
		v
		Example text.
		_More text. (???)



	2)	{#}	
	2.1)
		Two curly braces (U+007B & U+007D) with a number between "{0}", "{1}" etc are used to hold the place for another word to go. This means that we can use one string but fill in the missing pieces as needed. If you pick up an item, a sword for example, the game inserts the name of the item you picked up into the string.

		Original: 	"You found {0}!"
		Items: 		a gun, a sword, a pipe, a health potion
		You read: 	"You found a sword!" !!OK!!
		---Later you pick up a health potion.---
		You read: 	"You found a health potion!" !!OK!!

	2.2)
		The number in the brackets is important. If there is more than one item to fill in, the game makes a list of the things, then puts them in the string in the order of the numbers.

		Original: 	"{1} found {0}!"
		Items: 		a gun, a sword, a pipe
		Names: 		You, Harry, Dr. Who
		---In game, Harry picks up a pipe.---
		You read: 	"Harry found a pipe!" !!OK!!
		---If the numbers in the string are switched during translation...---
		Translate:	"{0} encontró {1}!" !!NO!!
		You read:	"una pipa encontró Harry!" !!NO!!

	2.3)
		Please be sure to put the {#} in the correct place so that it makes sense for your language. It is OK to put the {#}s in a different order, as long as that would match what the original sentence means in your language.
		
		Original:	"{0}を{1}は見つけた!"
		Translate:	"{1} hat {0} gefunden!" !!OK!!
		You read:	"Harry hat eine Pfeife gefunden!" !!OK!!

	2.4)
		You *should* put spaces where necessary when using {#}. 

		Translate:	"{1}hat{0}gefunden!" !!NO!!
		You read:	"HarryhateinePfeifegefunden!" !!NO!!



	3)	''	(I will use [ ] instead of " " for this section for obvious reasons.)
!!	3.1)
		The use of two apostrophes [''] (U+0027) is changed into a single quotation mark ["] in the game.

		Original:	[Town Mayor: ''Go directly to jail!'']
		You Read:	[Town Mayor: "Go directly to jail!"]
!!	3.2)
		It is important to *not* use ["] in translated text, because ???



	4)	:@SOME_VARIABLE
	4.1)
		If you see ":@" (U+003A & U+0040) followed by some text, please copy this exactly to your translation. It is a reference to another string.
	4.2)
		Each string has a unique name like "DC3-JB02" or "DC-Help-SubQuest". If we make a new unique name that is used in a different way, but want to use *the same text as another string*, we can copy the old string (in the game) instead of translating it twice.

		String Name:	"WEAP_01"
		"WEAP_01":		"This is a one-handed sword."
		String Name:	"WEAP_02"
		"WEAP_02":		":@WEAP_01"
		Message:		"WEAP_01"
		You read:		"This is a one-handed sword."
		Message:		"WEAP_02"
		You read:		"This is a one-handed sword."
